#polymorphism  
aggregation  
has-a is a way to share data between classes.  
inheritance is another way to share data. keyword: **extends**.  
New keyword: **protected**  
this shares data to classes in the same module. shown with a "#" in UML 

**subclass** also called a child class.  

**superclass** also called *parent class* and *base class*.  

subclasses get direct access to all of the public and protected data and methods from their superclass  
- may have to implement methods again if we need more specific behavior.  

A relationship represented by aggregation (with a diamond in UML) is "**has-a**".
A relationship represented by inheritance (with an open headed arrow in UML) is "**is-a**".
Inheritance breaks encapsulation if we use the *protected* keyword.  
Aggregation / composition do not break encapsulation.
